## Overview

This readme is to give instruction on how to play the Memory game, list the files used in creating my Memory game, credit contributers, list useful resources and share future planned developments.
The project started with an initial template provided by Udacity consisting of a flat file UI and a card shuffle function [Udacity git repo](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game) 
Below is an overview of what is in scope of this project and the linked manual and what is not:

## Instructions

Use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) for self-checking your submission.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

Your **README.md** file should be updated with instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

### Players

## Useful resources

In the following links you will find resources that i utilised whilst building the memory game:
* [W3C's index of HTML5](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/)
* [W3School's JS tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)
* [Udacity git repo](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game)
* [MDN's javascript documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web/JavaScript)

Any suggestions of additional resources that would be useful to the community
would be warmly welcome and greatly appreciated.
Feel free to add your suggestions by creating a new pull request
with the component "Documentation" with your
comment.

## Troubleshooting

TBC

## Future developments

I will be adding a link to my Kanban board for future updates to this and other projects, but before this, below is a short list of nice to haves in the short term:

* Updated UI - I would like to add card flip animation and make the colour scheme a little more personal
* Winning - Make the act of winning have an incentive
* Start page - Add a start menu

Lastly, efforts could be made and hopefully sustained on the overall
maintenance, with improved documentation, tutorials/presentations of how
features could be leveraged or extended and of course the usual bug fixes.

## Contributions

Feel free to follow up in the issue queue for any contributions, bug
reports, feature requests.
Tests, feedback or comments in general are highly appreciated.

For details, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Credits

We are particularly grateful to the Udacity community behind the creation of the FEND course, their authors and all their contributors for their great work from which this memory game was greatly inspired and without which perhaps i would not be the front end dev I am today.
Hopefully, new features, patches or tests added to this repo might as well be ported/adapted to be contributed and shared back in return.
